## The IIT Madras Foundational Courses Blueprint

### General Approach to All Courses:

*   **Understand the "Why":** Why is this topic relevant to Data Science? (Even for English, consider communication of findings).
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just read; *do*. Work through examples, trace pseudocode, solve problems.
*   **Mistake Analysis:** Every wrong answer is a learning opportunity. Understand *why* you made a mistake and *how* to prevent it next time.
*   **Time Management:** Practice solving problems under timed conditions. Some complex problems might need to be skipped initially if they consume too much time.
*   **Read Instructions Carefully:** Especially for MCQs vs. MSQs, and SA numerical precision.

    *   **Diphthongs:** Two vowel sounds together (e.g., `oy` in "boy").
    *   **Semi-vowels:** /w/, /y/ (act as consonants at word start, but like vowels in some contexts).
    *   **Word Stress & Syllabification:** Placement of emphasis, breaking words into syllables.
*   **Reading Comprehension Skills:** Skimming (for gist), Scanning (for specific info), Inferring (deducing unstated info).

#### 1.2 Question Blueprint (Patterns & Dissection)

*   **Reading Comprehension (Passage-based):**
    *   **Pattern:** Long text followed by multiple MCQs (5-10 questions). Questions cover main idea, specific details, inferences, vocabulary *in context*, meaning of phrases/idioms *in context*.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **First Read (Skim):** Get the gist, main topic, and author's purpose.
        2.  **Second Read (Active):** Read more slowly, highlighting/noting key arguments, facts, and unfamiliar terms.
        3.  **Analyze Question:** Understand what specific information is being asked (direct fact, inference, vocabulary).
        4.  **Scan for Keywords:** Locate relevant sections in the passage using keywords from the question.
        5.  **Evaluate Options:** Eliminate distractors. Choose the best fit, ensuring it's supported by the text. For inference, ensure it's a logical deduction, not just a possibility.
    *   **"Thingies":** Don't bring outside knowledge. Stick strictly to the passage. Context is king for vocabulary. Manage time; don't get stuck on one detail.
*   **Grammar & Parts of Speech (Identification/Usage):**
    *   **Pattern:** Identifying parts of speech of underlined words; filling blanks with correct articles, prepositions, tenses, modal verbs, pronouns, conjunctions; identifying incorrect sentences.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Identify Word/Context:** Look at the word or the blank in the sentence.
        2.  **Recall Rules:** Apply relevant grammar rules (e.g., subject-verb agreement for tenses, noun/verb usage).
        3.  **Test Options:** Mentally insert each option (if MCQ) and see if the sentence sounds grammatically correct and coherent.
        4.  **Dissect "Incorrect Sentence":** For error identification, scrutinize subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement, parallel structure, proper use of conjunctions/prepositions/adverbs.
    *   **"Thingies":** Regular practice on grammar exercises. Pay attention to agreement rules. Common errors include `than/then`, `affect/effect`, `its/it's`.
*   **Vocabulary (Idioms, Phrasal Verbs, Syn/Ant):**
    *   **Pattern:** Choosing the meaning of an idiom/phrasal verb; identifying synonyms/antonyms; matching collocations.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Context First:** If in a passage, re-read the sentence containing the phrase. Try to infer meaning.
        2.  **Recall Direct Meaning:** If a standalone idiom, retrieve its known meaning.
        3.  **Analyze Options:** Choose the option closest to the literal or inferred meaning.
        4.  **For Syn/Ant:** Consider the nuances.
    *   **"Thingies":** Build a dedicated vocabulary list. Focus on high-frequency idioms. The more you read, the better your intuition.
*   **Phonetics:**
    *   **Pattern:** "Odd one out" based on a specific sound; identifying semi-vowel transitions; syllabification rules.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Pronounce (Mentally/Silently):** Articulate the words/sounds as clearly as possible.
        2.  **Isolate Sound:** Focus on the specific underlined sound or the target sound.
        3.  **Compare:** Match the sound across options.
        4.  **For Syllables:** Break words down by vowel sounds and consonant clusters.
    *   **"Thingies":** This is often neglected. Use online pronunciation dictionaries (e.g., those showing IPA). Practice distinguishing tricky sounds (e.g., short 'u' vs. long 'u').
*   **Conversational English:**
    *   **Pattern:** Filling in blanks in dialogues (e.g., phone calls); True/False statements about conversational norms.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Identify Context:** Is it formal or informal? What is the relationship between speakers?
        2.  **Consider Intent:** What is the speaker trying to achieve (ask for help, politely decline, convey information)?
        3.  **Choose Appropriately:** Select the option that is most polite, clear, and fits the social context.
    *   **"Thingies":** Think about real-world scenarios. Phrases like "May I help you?", "Please hold," "I'm sorry to disturb you" are common.

    *   **Collinearity:** Area = 0, or slopes between pairs of points are equal.
    *   **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE):** For observed $y_i$ and predicted $\hat{y}_i$, $SSE = \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$.
*   **Quadratic Functions ($f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$):**
    *   **Graph:** Parabola. $a > 0 \implies$ opens up (min); $a < 0 \implies$ opens down (max).
    *   **Vertex (x-coord):** $-b/(2a)$. (This is also the axis of symmetry $x = -b/(2a)$).
    *   **Y-intercept:** $c$.
    *   **Roots (for $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$):**
        *   Sum: $\alpha + \beta = -b/a$.

#### 2.2 Question Blueprint (Patterns & Dissection)

*   **Set Theory (Cardinality & Word Problems):**
    *   **Pattern:** Word problems describing overlapping groups. Asking for "number of elements taking none/exactly one/at least one."
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Draw Venn Diagram:** Sketch 2 or 3 overlapping circles.
        2.  **Fill from Center Out:** Start with $|A \cap B \cap C|$, then fill in two-way overlaps, then single regions.
        3.  **Apply Inclusion-Exclusion:** Use the formula (see "Thingies") or sum up the regions in the Venn Diagram.
        4.  **Subtract from Total:** If asked for "none," subtract $|A \cup B \cup C|$ from the total.
    *   **"Thingies":** Use the formula. Be careful with calculations.
*   **Relations (Properties Check):**
    *   **Pattern:** Given a set and a relation (either listed pairs or a rule like $y=x+2$), identify which properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive) it has. Often MSQ.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **List all pairs:** If defined by a rule, explicitly list all pairs that satisfy the rule and are within the Cartesian product of the set.
        2.  **Systematic Check:** Go through Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive in order. For "not" properties, provide a single counterexample.
        3.  **Deduce Equivalence/Identity:** If all three main properties hold, it's equivalence. Identity is very specific (only self-loops).
    *   **"Thingies":** Definitions must be solid. Use counterexamples for "not."
*   **Functions (Identification & Types):**
    *   **Pattern:** Determine if a relation is a function; if so, classify it as injective/surjective/bijective.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Function check:** Is every domain element mapped? Is any mapped *more than once*?
        2.  **Injective check:** Do distinct inputs lead to distinct outputs? (Horizontal line test for graphs).
        3.  **Surjective check:** Does every element in the *codomain* have a corresponding input? (Is range = codomain?).
    *   **"Thingies":** Horizontal Line Test helps visualize one-to-one.
*   **Linear Equations & Geometry:**
    *   **Pattern:** Find line equation from points/slopes; calculate intersection points; find $m+c$ for a line related to a function.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Extract Info:** Identify given points, slopes, parallel/perpendicular conditions.
        2.  **Form Equations:** Use point-slope or slope-intercept form.
        3.  **Solve System:** For intersection, solve the two linear equations simultaneously.
        4.  **Geometric Formulas:** Apply area formula or distance formula as needed.
    *   **"Thingies":** Pay attention to phrasing like "collides" (intersection).
*   **Quadratic Functions & Polynomials (Properties & Graphs):**
    *   **Pattern:** Find new quadratic equation from transformed roots; identify coefficients from slope info; interpret increasing/decreasing intervals from $a$ sign and vertex; matching graphs to polynomials.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Roots Transformation:** Use sum/product of roots. $(\alpha^2+\beta^2) = (\alpha+\beta)^2-2\alpha\beta$.
        2.  **Vertex/Axis of Symmetry:** Know $x=-b/(2a)$. Relate $a$ to opening direction.
        3.  **Derivative Usage:** $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2ax+b$. Use given slopes to form and solve linear equations for $a,b$.
        4.  **End Behavior:** Determine from degree and leading coefficient.
        5.  **Root Multiplicities:** Sketch behavior at roots (cross vs. touch-and-turn).
        6.  **Turning Points:** Max $n-1$.
    *   **"Thingies":** The derivative is the slope function. The vertex is where slope is zero. For graph matching, focus on end behavior, roots, and their multiplicities first.
*   **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE):**
    *   **Pattern:** Given data points and a best-fit line, calculate SSE.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Predict $\hat{y}$:** For each $x_i$, plug into the line equation to get $\hat{y}_i$.
        2.  **Calculate Error:** $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$.
        3.  **Square Errors:** $e_i^2$.
        4.  **Sum Squared Errors:** $\sum e_i^2$.
    *   **"Thingies":** Basic formula application. Meticulous calculation.

    *   **Median:** Middle value when data is ordered. For even $N$, average of two middle values.
    *   **Mode:** Most frequent value. Can be unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, or no mode.
*   **Measures of Dispersion:**
    *   **Range:** Max - Min.
    *   **Variance ($\sigma^2$ or $s^2$):** Average of squared deviations from the mean.
        *   Population: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N} = \frac{\sum x_i^2}{N} - \mu^2$.
        *   Sample: $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} = \frac{\sum x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2}{n-1}$.
    *   **Standard Deviation ($\sigma$ or $s$):** $\sqrt{\text{Variance}}$.

    *   **Covariance:** Measures direction of linear relationship. $\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{N}$ (population) or $\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n-1}$ (sample).
    *   **Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($r$):** Measures strength and direction of *linear* relationship. $r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{S_X S_Y}$. Ranges from -1 to 1, unitless.
    *   **Point Bi-serial Correlation ($r_{pb}$):** For one dichotomous and one continuous variable. $r_{pb} = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_0}{S_X} \sqrt{\frac{n_1 n_0}{N^2}}$.

---

#### 3.2 Question Blueprint (Patterns & Dissection)

*   **Data Types & Scales (Categorization):**
    *   **Pattern:** Given a variable/scenario, identify its type (categorical/numerical, time series/cross-sectional) and scale of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Categorical or Numerical?** Can it be measured numerically or is it a label?
        2.  **If Categorical:** Is there an order (Ordinal) or just labels (Nominal)?
        3.  **If Numerical:** Are differences meaningful and equal (Interval)? Is there a true zero where absence means zero (Ratio)?
        4.  **Time/Cross:** Is it collected over time for one entity (Time Series) or at one point for many (Cross-Sectional)?
    *   **"Thingies":** Memorize the hierarchy: Nominal $\to$ Ordinal $\to$ Interval $\to$ Ratio. Each level inherits properties from below. True zero is the key for Ratio.
*   **Central Tendency & Dispersion (Calculations):**
    *   **Pattern:** Calculate mean, median, mode, range, variance, SD, IQR, percentiles from raw data, frequency tables, or stem-and-leaf plots.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **List Data:** Convert stem-and-leaf to ordered list.
        2.  **Choose Formula:** Use correct sample/population formulas for variance/SD.
        3.  **Systematic Calculation:**
            *   Mean: Sum all values, divide by count.
            *   Median: Order, find middle.
            *   Mode: Count frequencies.
            *   Variance/SD: Calculate mean, then deviations, square, sum, divide. Or use computational formula $\frac{\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2/n}{n-1}$ (sample) or $\frac{\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2/N}{N}$ (population).
            *   IQR/Percentiles: Order data, find position $P = (\text{percentile}/100) \times N$.
        4.  **Numerical Precision:** Pay close attention to required decimal places.
    *   **"Thingies":** Practice these calculations until they're second nature. Errors often come from arithmetic mistakes or using the wrong $N$ vs $N-1$.
*   **Data Transformations (Impact on Measures):**
    *   **Pattern:** A dataset has its mean/SD/etc. known. New data is created by adding/multiplying a constant to each observation. Find the new mean/SD/etc.
    *   **Solution Steps:** Apply the transformation rules directly (see "Thingies").
    *   **"Thingies":**
        *   `Mean/Median/Mode`: transform same way as data.
        *   `Range/SD/IQR`: only affected by *multiplication* (by $|K|$).
        *   `Variance`: only affected by *multiplication* (by $K^2$).
*   **Association (Correlation/Covariance):**
    *   **Pattern:** Calculate correlation/covariance; interpret strength/direction of relationship; identify type of correlation (e.g., Point Bi-serial).
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Categorize Variables:** Determine if continuous/dichotomous for selecting appropriate correlation.
        2.  **Calculate Means:** For each variable.
        3.  **Calculate Deviations:** $(x_i - \bar{x})$, $(y_i - \bar{y})$.
        4.  **Calculate Covariance:** Sum products of deviations.
        5.  **Calculate SDs:** For each variable.
        6.  **Apply Correlation Formula:** $\frac{\text{Cov}}{S_X S_Y}$.
        7.  **Interpret:** Close to 1 means strong positive; close to -1 means strong negative; close to 0 means weak/no linear relationship.
    *   **"Thingies":** Correlation is *unitless* and *insensitive to linear shifts/scales*. Only its sign changes if one variable is multiplied by a negative.
*   **Data Representativeness (Sample vs. Population):**
    *   **Pattern:** Given a sampling method and a population, determine if the sample is representative.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Define Population Clearly:** Who is the *entire group* of interest?
        2.  **Define Sample Clearly:** Who was *actually chosen*?
        3.  **Compare:** Does the sample's composition (demographics, characteristics) reflect the population's composition adequately for the research question? (e.g., only final year students for *all* students' opinion is not representative).
    *   **"Thingies":** Random sampling helps, but must be *from the correct population* for representativeness. Bias is key.

    *   **Flags:** Boolean variables to track a state or condition (e.g., `Found = True`).
*   **Problem Decomposition:** Breaking down a large problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems (e.g., using procedures).

#### 4.2 Question Blueprint (Patterns & Dissection)

*   **Pseudocode Tracing & Output Prediction:**
    *   **Pattern:** Given pseudocode and a dataset (e.g., "Scores", "Words", "Shopping Bills", "Olympics"), predict the final value of a variable (`A`, `count`, `Sum`).
    *   **Solution Steps (The Golden Rule):**
        1.  **Setup Trace Table:** Draw columns for each variable (including loop counters, flags) and a column for notes/output.
        2.  **Initialize Variables:** Fill in initial values from the pseudocode.
        3.  **Step-by-Step Execution:** Go line by line. Update variable values as they change.
        4.  **Loop Control:** For `while` loops, explicitly check the condition *before* each iteration.
        5.  **Procedure Calls:** When a procedure is called, jump to its code, trace its execution, and note its return value. Then continue the calling code.
        6.  **Data Movement:** Pay attention to `Move X to Table Y` as this affects which data is available in which "pile."
        7.  **Final Value:** The last value of the target variable is your answer.
    *   **"Thingies":** Be incredibly meticulous. A single missed update or mis-evaluation of a boolean can lead to a wrong answer. Practice, practice, practice.
*   **Pseudocode Debugging & Error Identification:**
    *   **Pattern:** Given pseudocode with a stated goal, identify lines that contain errors (MSQ). Errors can be logical or structural.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Understand Goal:** Clearly define what the pseudocode *should* do.
        2.  **Trace (Mentally/Roughly):** Do a quick trace with a small, representative dataset.
        3.  **Compare Actual vs. Desired:** For each line identified in options, ask: "Does this line, in combination with others, achieve the *intended* purpose?"
        4.  **Common Pitfalls to Check:**
            *   **Initialization:** Are variables set to correct starting values? (e.g., max should start low, min should start high).
            *   **Loop Conditions:** Are they correct for iterating through all data/stopping at the right time?
            *   **Boolean Logic:** Is `AND` vs. `OR` used correctly? Is negation applied correctly (`NOT`)?
            *   **Variable Updates:** Is `A = A + 1` in the right place? Is `A = X.Value` intended or `A = A + X.Value`?
            *   **Data Movement:** Are cards moved to the correct tables? Are tables being emptied/refilled as intended?
            *   **Return Values:** Is the correct value returned by procedures?
    *   **"Thingies":** Develop an "error-spotting" checklist. Logical errors are harder than syntax.
*   **Pseudocode Completion (Fill-in-the-Blanks):**
    *   **Pattern:** Pseudocode with a missing logical condition or a variable update statement. Choose the correct fragment.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Analyze Context:** What is the `if` statement trying to achieve? What values are available?
        2.  **Identify Variables:** What boolean flags or numeric variables are being set/compared?
        3.  **Formulate Logic:** Write out the required condition/update in plain English, then translate to pseudocode.
        4.  **Test Mentally:** Does the inserted fragment work for different test cases?
    *   **"Thingies":** Often tests correct use of `AND`/`OR` or proper assignment logic.
*   **Purpose of Pseudocode/Variable:**
    *   **Pattern:** Given complete pseudocode, state what a specific variable or the entire code represents at the end.
    *   **Solution Steps:**
        1.  **Trace Briefly:** A quick trace helps confirm the flow.
        2.  **Focus on Accumulator/Final Variable:** Look at how the target variable is updated within loops and conditionals.
        3.  **Synthesize:** Describe the overall effect of the updates in a concise statement.
    *   **"Thingies":** Distinguish between "total count," "number of pairs," "maximum value," "average."
