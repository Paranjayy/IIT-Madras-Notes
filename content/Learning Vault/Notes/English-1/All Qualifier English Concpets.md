# Week 1: Sounds and Words (Vowel and Consonant sounds)

*   **Phonetics:** The study of speech sounds. English spelling is irregular, so understanding sounds is key to pronunciation.
*   **Speech Organs:** Lungs, vocal cords, tongue, lips, teeth, etc., are used to produce sounds.
*   **Vowels:** Sounds produced with a relatively open vocal tract.
    *   Classified by **tongue position (front/central/back)**, **tongue height (high/mid/low)**, and **lip rounding**.
    *   **Monophthongs:** Pure vowel sounds (single sound, e.g., 'ee' in `see`).
    *   **Diphthongs:** Gliding vowel sounds (sound changes within the syllable, e.g., 'oy' in `boy`).
*   **Consonants:** Sounds produced by obstructing airflow.
    *   Classified by **Place of Articulation** (where obstruction occurs, e.g., bilabial, alveolar), **Manner of Articulation** (how airflow is obstructed, e.g., plosive, fricative), and **Voicing** (vocal cords vibrate or not).
*   **Morphemes:** Smallest units of meaning. **Free morphemes** (stand alone, e.g., `cat`) vs. **Bound morphemes** (attached, e.g., `-s`, `un-`).

# Week 2: Parts of Speech

*   **Parts of Speech:** Categories of words based on their grammatical function and meaning. A word's part of speech depends on its use in a sentence.
*   **The Nine Parts:**
    1.  **Nouns:** Person, place, thing, idea (e.g., `student`, `Paris`, `book`, `freedom`).
    2.  **Pronouns:** Replace nouns (e.g., `he`, `she`, `it`, `they`, `this`).
    3.  **Verbs:** Action or state of being (e.g., `run`, `is`, `become`).
    4.  **Adjectives:** Describe nouns/pronouns (e.g., `happy`, `blue`).
    5.  **Adverbs:** Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (e.g., `quickly`, `very`).
    6.  **Prepositions:** Show relationship between noun/pronoun and another word (e.g., `in`, `on`, `at`). Forms prepositional phrases.
    7.  **Conjunctions:** Join words, phrases, clauses (e.g., `and`, `but`, `because`).
    8.  **Interjections:** Express strong emotion (e.g., `Wow!`, `Ouch!`).
    9.  **Determiners:** Introduce nouns, specify quantity/possession/definiteness (e.g., `a`, `the`, `my`, `some`). Often grouped with adjectives.

# Week 3: Sentences (Phrases and Idioms)

*   **Sentence:** A group of words expressing a complete thought, typically containing a **subject** and a **predicate**.
*   **Sentence Types (by Purpose):**
    *   **Declarative:** Makes a statement.
    *   **Interrogative:** Asks a question.
    *   **Imperative:** Gives a command/request.
    *   **Exclamatory:** Expresses strong emotion.
*   **Sentence Types (by Structure):** Based on independent/dependent clauses.
    *   **Simple:** One independent clause.
    *   **Compound:** Two or more independent clauses.
    *   **Complex:** One independent + one or more dependent clauses.
    *   **Compound-Complex:** Two or more independent + one or more dependent clauses.
*   **Phrases:** A group of words that acts as a unit but does **not** contain both a subject and a predicate (e.g., `on the table`, `running quickly`).
*   **Clauses:** A group of words that **does** contain both a subject and a predicate.
    *   **Independent Clause:** Can stand alone as a sentence.
    *   **Dependent Clause:** Cannot stand alone; relies on an independent clause.
*   **Idioms:** Expressions whose meaning cannot be understood from the literal meaning of its individual words (e.g., `raining cats and dogs`).

# Week 4: Speaking Skills (Spoken English Preliminaries)

*   **Pronunciation:** Clear **articulation** and appropriate **pace** are essential.
*   **Prosody (The Music of English):**
    *   **Intonation:** Rise and fall of voice (e.g., rising for questions, falling for statements).
    *   **Word Stress:** Emphasis on certain syllables within a word.
    *   **Sentence Stress:** Emphasis on key words in a sentence to convey meaning.
    *   **Linking Sounds:** Blending sounds between words in natural speech (e.g., `an_apple`).
*   **Active Listening:** Crucial for effective communication. Involves paying full attention, showing engagement (nodding, verbal cues), asking clarifying questions, and paraphrasing.
*   **Conversational Strategies:** Techniques for initiating, maintaining, and concluding conversations smoothly. Includes polite turn-taking and appropriate use of fillers.
*   **Building Confidence:** Regular practice, imitating fluent speakers, self-recording, and embracing mistakes are key to improving spoken English.
*   **Register & Tone:** Adjusting language and voice quality based on context and audience (formal/informal).
