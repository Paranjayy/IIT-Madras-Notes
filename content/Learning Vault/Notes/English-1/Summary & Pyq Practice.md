**Question 23 (July 2024 QDF4)**
**Question ID:** 640653827156

*   6406532780252. Adjective

*   6406532780255. Adverb

**Solution Breakdown:**

1.  **Recall Parts of Speech (Week 2):**
    *   **Adjective:** Describes a noun (e.g., `the house beyond`).
    *   **Interjection:** Expresses strong emotion (e.g., `Wow!`).
    *   **Preposition:** Shows relationship between a noun/pronoun (its object) and another word, indicating position, direction, time, etc. (e.g., `beyond the wall`).

    *   Here, `beyond` relates "additional comment" to "Zuckerberg's post," indicating a limit or scope (i.e., "nothing further than"). "Zuckerberg's post" is the object of the preposition.

### Pattern 2: Phonetics & Sounds

These questions test your understanding of English speech sounds, including vowels, consonants, diphthongs, and how sounds are articulated.

**Key Concepts (Week 1):**
*   **Vowel Sounds:** Produced with open vocal tract. Monophthongs (pure) vs. Diphthongs (gliding).
*   **Consonant Sounds:** Produced with obstructed airflow. Classified by Place of Articulation, Manner of Articulation, and Voicing.
*   **Semi-vowels:** Sounds that behave like consonants but have vowel-like qualities (`y` /j/, `w` /w/).
*   **Word Stress:** Emphasis on certain syllables.
*   **Odd One Out:** Identifying words that deviate phonetically from a group.

**Question 26 (July 2024 QDF4)**
**Question ID:** 640653827159
**Question Type:** MCQ
**Problem Statement:**
Choose the word without an “ii” sound from the following.
**Options:**
*   6406532780263. Meet
*   6406532780264. Lead
*   6406532780265. Wet (Correct)
*   6406532780266. Wheat

**Solution Breakdown:**

The "ii" sound typically refers to the long `e` sound, phonetically represented as `/iː/`.

*   `Meet`: The `ee` produces the long `e` sound (`/miːt/`).
*   `Lead`: The `ea` produces the long `e` sound (`/liːd/`).
*   `Wet`: The `e` produces a short `e` sound (`/wɛt/`). This is NOT the "ii" sound.
*   `Wheat`: The `ea` produces the long `e` sound (`/wiːt/`).

**Correct Answer: Option 6406532780265 (Wet)**

**Question 28 (July 2024 QDF4)**
**Question ID:** 640653827161
**Question Type:** MCQ
**Problem Statement:**
Which semi-vowel occurs in the transition between the words 'me' and ‘off’ in the sentence ‘he pushed me off the chair'?
**Options:**
*   6406532780271. /w/
*   6406532780272. /y/ (Correct)

**Solution Breakdown:**

1.  **Semi-vowels:** The two main semi-vowels in English are /j/ (as in `yes`, `yacht`) and /w/ (as in `we`, `water`). They are vowel-like in production but function as consonants.
2.  **Analyze the transition:** When "me" (ending with the long `e` sound /iː/) is followed by "off" (starting with the vowel sound /ɒ/), there's a natural, subtle glide sound in between.
    *   `me` /miː/ + `off` /ɒf/
    *   The tongue is high and front for /iː/. To move to the `o` sound of `off`, it naturally creates a brief /j/ sound. Think of it as `mee-yoff`.
    *   This is known as a **palatal glide**.

**Correct Answer: Option 6406532780272 (/y/)**

**Question 29 (July 2024 QDF4)**

*   6406532780275. Pout
*   6406532780276. Moot (Correct)

**Solution Breakdown:**

1.  **Diphthong (Week 1):** A vowel sound that involves a glide from one vowel quality to another in the same syllable (e.g., `buy` /baɪ/, `cow` /kaʊ/).
2.  **Analyze the words:**
    *   `Mouth`: Contains the diphthong `/aʊ/` (as in `cow`).
    *   `South`: Contains the diphthong `/aʊ/` (as in `cow`).
    *   `Pout`: Contains the diphthong `/aʊ/` (as in `cow`).
    *   `Moot`: Contains the monophthong (pure vowel) `/uː/` (as in `moon`). There is no glide here.

**Question 33 (July 2024 QDF4)**
**Question ID:** 640653827166
**Question Type:** MCQ
**Problem Statement:**
Identify the part of speech of the underlined word:
They were quick to throw up `their` hands in surrender.
**Options:**
*   6406532780288. Noun
*   6406532780289. Pronoun (Correct)
*   6406532780290. Verb
*   6406532780291. Conjunction

**Solution Breakdown:**

1.  **Analyze the word "their":** `Their` is used to show possession; it indicates that the hands belong to "they."
2.  **Recall Parts of Speech (Week 2):**
    *   **Nouns** name people, places, things.
    *   **Pronouns** replace nouns (e.g., `he`, `she`, `it`, `they`, `their` as a possessive pronoun/determiner).
    *   **Verbs** describe actions or states.
    *   **Conjunctions** join words, phrases, or clauses.
3.  **Specific Type:** `Their` is a possessive form that functions as a determiner (a type of pronoun that modifies a noun). In this context, it acts like an adjective, telling us *whose* hands. However, it falls under the broader category of `Pronoun` due to its origin and function of indicating possession related to a group (`they`).

**Correct Answer: Option 6406532780289 (Pronoun)**

**Solution Breakdown:**
