# WEEK 2: Parts of Speech

Now that we've explored the individual sounds and the basic structure of words, let's look at how words function within sentences. `Parts of Speech` are categories of words based on their grammatical function and meaning. Knowing them is like understanding the roles of different players in a team – each has a specific job, and they work together to achieve a common goal (a clear sentence!).

## 2.1 Why Categorize Words?

Categorizing words helps us:
*   Understand the structure of sentences.
*   Apply correct grammatical rules (e.g., subject-verb agreement).
*   Interpret the meaning of sentences accurately.
*   Construct grammatically correct and meaningful sentences ourselves.

## 2.2 The Nine Parts of Speech

While traditionally taught as eight, some modern grammars separate `determiners` from `adjectives`, bringing the total to nine. We'll cover all key categories.

### 2.2.1 Nouns (The "Things" and "Ideas")

*   **Definition:** Words that name a person, place, thing, or idea. They are often the subject or object of a verb.
*   **Examples:** `student`, `teacher`, `Maria` (person); `city`, `school`, `Paris` (place); `book`, `table`, `computer` (thing); `freedom`, `happiness`, `love` (idea).
*   **Types of Nouns:**
    *   **Common Nouns:** General names for people, places, things, or ideas. They are not capitalized unless they start a sentence (e.g., `dog`, `country`, `happiness`).
    *   **Proper Nouns:** Specific names for individual people, places, organizations, or days of the week/months. They are always capitalized (e.g., `Fido`, `India`, `Monday`).
    *   **Concrete Nouns:** Refer to things that can be perceived by one or more of the five senses (e.g., `table`, `music`, `perfume`).
    *   **Abstract Nouns:** Refer to ideas, qualities, or states that cannot be perceived by the senses (e.g., `love`, `courage`, `time`).
    *   **Countable Nouns:** Refer to things that can be counted and have both singular and plural forms (e.g., `apple` (apples), `chair` (chairs)).
    *   **Uncountable Nouns (Mass Nouns):** Refer to things that cannot be counted individually and typically do not have a plural form (e.g., `water`, `information`, `advice`).
    *   **Collective Nouns:** Refer to a group of people, animals, or things as a single unit (e.g., `team`, `family`, `flock`, `audience`).

### 2.2.2 Pronouns (The "Substitutes")

*   **Definition:** Words that replace a noun or another pronoun to avoid repetition.
*   **Examples:** `he`, `she`, `it`, `they`, `we`, `you`, `I`, `me`, `him`, `her`, `us`, `them`, `this`, `that`, `these`, `those`, `who`, `whom`, `whose`, `which`, `what`, `everyone`, `somebody`.
*   **Types of Pronouns:**
    *   **Personal Pronouns:** Refer to specific persons or things, changing form based on whether they are the subject (`I`, `you`, `he`, `she`, `it`, `we`, `they`) or object (`me`, `you`, `him`, `her`, `it`, `us`, `them`) in a sentence.
    *   **Possessive Pronouns:** Show ownership (e.g., `mine`, `yours`, `his`, `hers`, `its`, `ours`, `theirs`).
    *   **Reflexive Pronouns:** Refer back to the subject of the sentence and always end in `-self` or `-selves` (e.g., `myself`, `yourself`, `himself`, `themselves`).
    *   **Demonstrative Pronouns:** Point to specific nouns or groups of nouns (e.g., `this`, `that`, `these`, `those`).
    *   **Interrogative Pronouns:** Used to ask questions (e.g., `who`, `whom`, `whose`, `which`, `what`).
    *   **Relative Pronouns:** Introduce dependent clauses (subordinate clauses) and connect them to an independent clause (e.g., `who`, `whom`, `whose`, `which`, `that`).
    *   **Indefinite Pronouns:** Refer to non-specific persons or things (e.g., `everyone`, `anything`, `somebody`, `no one`).

### 2.2.3 Verbs (The "Actions" and "States")

*   **Definition:** Words that describe an action, state, or occurrence. They are the most crucial part of a sentence as they typically form the predicate.
*   **Examples:** `run`, `eat`, `think`, `is`, `become`, `have`, `can`.
*   **Types of Verbs:**
    *   **Action Verbs:** Describe physical or mental actions (e.g., `run`, `sing`, `believe`, `consider`).
    *   **Linking Verbs:** Connect the subject to a noun or adjective that renames or describes it, showing a state of being rather than an action. Common linking verbs include forms of `to be` (`is`, `am`, `are`, `was`, `were`), `become`, `seem`, `feel`.
    *   **Helping Verbs (Auxiliary Verbs):** Assist the main verb to express tense, mood, or voice. These include forms of `to have` (`has eaten`), `to do` (`did go`), `to be` (`is running`), and modals like `can`, `will` (`can swim`).
*   **Tenses (Brief Mention):** Verbs change form to indicate when an action happens (past, present, future). This will be explored in Week 5.

### 2.2.4 Adjectives (The "Descriptors")

*   **Definition:** Words that describe or modify nouns and pronouns, providing more information about their qualities.
*   **Examples:** `happy`, `tall`, `blue`, `smart`, `old`.
*   **Placement:** Adjectives are usually placed before the noun they modify (`a **red** car`) or after a linking verb, describing the subject (`The car is **red**`).
*   **Degrees of Comparison (Brief):** Adjectives can show comparison:
    *   **Positive Degree:** Describes a quality without comparison (e.g., `tall`).
    *   **Comparative Degree:** Compares two things (e.g., `taller`).
    *   **Superlative Degree:** Compares three or more things, indicating the highest or lowest degree of a quality (e.g., `tallest`).

### 2.2.5 Adverbs (The "Modifiers")

*   **Definition:** Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, providing information about how, when, where, or to what extent something happens.
*   **Examples:** `quickly`, `yesterday`, `here`, `very`, `always`.
*   **Types of Adverbs:**
    *   **Adverbs of Manner:** Answer the question "How?" (e.g., `loudly`, `carefully`, `happily`).
    *   **Adverbs of Place:** Answer the question "Where?" (e.g., `here`, `there`, `everywhere`, `upstairs`).
    *   **Adverbs of Time:** Answer the question "When?" (e.g., `now`, `yesterday`, `soon`, `always`).
    *   **Adverbs of Frequency:** Answer the question "How often?" (e.g., `always`, `never`, `sometimes`, `daily`).
    *   **Adverbs of Degree:** Answer the question "To what extent?" (e.g., `very`, `extremely`, `quite`, `too`).

### 2.2.6 Prepositions (The "Connectors of Relationship")

*   **Definition:** Words that show the relationship between a noun/pronoun (its object) and another word in the sentence. They typically indicate location, time, direction, or manner.
*   **Examples:** `in`, `on`, `at`, `under`, `over`, `to`, `from`, `with`, `by`, `for`, `about`, `during`.
*   **Prepositional Phrase:** A preposition followed by its object and any modifiers forms a prepositional phrase (e.g., `in **the box**`, `under **the old tree**`).

### 2.2.7 Conjunctions (The "Joiners")

*   **Definition:** Words that connect words, phrases, clauses, or sentences.
*   **Types of Conjunctions:**
    *   **Coordinating Conjunctions:** Connect grammatically equal elements (words, phrases, independent clauses). Remember the acronym FANBOYS: `For`, `And`, `Nor`, `But`, `Or`, `Yet`, `So` (e.g., `She sings **and** dances.`).
    *   **Subordinating Conjunctions:** Connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing a relationship of time, cause, effect, etc. (e.g., `**Because** it rained, we stayed inside.` Other examples: `after`, `although`, `as`, `before`, `if`, `since`, `though`, `unless`, `until`, `when`, `where`, `while`).
    *   **Correlative Conjunctions:** Pairs of conjunctions that work together to connect grammatically equal elements (e.g., `**either**...**or**`, `**neither**...**nor**`, `**not only**...**but also**`, `**both**...**and**`).

### 2.2.8 Interjections (The "Exclamations")

*   **Definition:** Words or short phrases that express strong emotion or sudden feeling. They often stand alone and are followed by an exclamation mark.
*   **Examples:** `Oh!`, `Wow!`, `Ouch!`, `Bravo!`, `Hey!`, `Oops!`.

### 2.2.9 Determiners (The "Specifiers" - often grouped with adjectives)

*   **Definition:** Words that introduce a noun and provide information about quantity, possession, or definiteness. They "determine" what kind of reference the noun is making.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Articles:** `a`, `an`, `the`.
    *   **Possessives:** `my`, `your`, `his`, `her`, `its`, `our`, `their`.
    *   **Demonstratives:** `this`, `that`, `these`, `those`.
    *   **Quantifiers:** `many`, `few`, `some`, `any`, `all`.

**⚠️ Common Pitfall:** Many words can function as different parts of speech depending on their role in a sentence. For example, `walk` can be a verb (`I walk daily.`) or a noun (`Let's go for a walk.`). Always look at the word's *function* in the specific sentence to correctly identify its part of speech.
