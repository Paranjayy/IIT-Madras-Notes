# WEEK 3: Sentences (Phrases and Idioms)

Building on our understanding of individual words, this week focuses on how words combine to form larger, meaningful units: sentences. We'll explore their structure, types, and delve into idiomatic expressions.

## 3.1 What is a Sentence?

At its core, a sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. For a sentence to be complete, it generally requires at least two main components:
*   **Subject:** Who or what the sentence is about (usually a noun or pronoun).
*   **Predicate:** What the subject does or is (contains the verb and related information).

**Example:**
*   `The cat` (Subject) `slept soundly.` (Predicate)

## 3.2 Sentence Types by Purpose (Function)

Sentences can be categorized by the purpose they serve in communication:

1.  **Declarative Sentence:** Makes a statement. It ends with a period.
    *   **Example:** `The sun rises in the east.`
2.  **Interrogative Sentence:** Asks a question. It ends with a question mark.
    *   **Example:** `Did you finish your homework?`
3.  **Imperative Sentence:** Gives a command or makes a request. The subject `you` is often implied but not stated. It usually ends with a period, but can end with an exclamation mark for strong commands.
    *   **Example:** `Please close the door.`
4.  **Exclamatory Sentence:** Expresses strong emotion or excitement. It ends with an exclamation mark.
    *   **Example:** `What a beautiful day!`, `I can't believe we won!`

## 3.3 Sentence Types by Structure

Understanding sentence structure helps in crafting varied and sophisticated writing. This classification depends on the number and type of clauses.

1.  **Simple Sentence:** Contains one independent clause (a single subject-verb combination that expresses a complete thought).
    *   **Example:** `Birds sing.` `The tall boy ran quickly.`
2.  **Compound Sentence:** Contains two or more independent clauses, joined by a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS), a semicolon, or a conjunctive adverb. Each independent clause could stand alone as a simple sentence.
    *   **Example:** `She wanted to go, but she was too tired.`
3.  **Complex Sentence:** Contains one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. Dependent clauses start with subordinating conjunctions (e.g., `because`, `although`, `when`) or relative pronouns (e.g., `who`, `which`, `that`) and cannot stand alone.
    *   **Example:** `Although it was raining, we went for a walk.`
4.  **Compound-Complex Sentence:** Contains two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses. It's a combination of compound and complex structures.
    *   **Example:** `Because I was late, I missed the bus, and then I had to walk.`

## 3.4 Phrases: Building Blocks Without a Complete Thought

A `phrase` is a group of words that functions as a single unit in a sentence but does not contain both a subject and a predicate (i.e., it doesn't express a complete thought on its own).

*   **Noun Phrase:** A group of words built around a noun or pronoun that acts as a single noun unit (e.g., `the *big, red ball*`).
*   **Verb Phrase:** Consists of a main verb and any helping verbs (e.g., `*has been singing*`).
*   **Adjective Phrase:** A group of words that functions as an adjective, modifying a noun or pronoun (e.g., `*very happy* with the results`).
*   **Adverb Phrase:** A group of words that functions as an adverb, modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb (e.g., `ran *with great speed*`).
*   **Prepositional Phrase:** A group of words beginning with a preposition, followed by its object (a noun or pronoun) and any modifiers (e.g., `*on the table*`, `*under the starry sky*`).

**üí° Intuition:** If a sentence is a house, words are bricks. Phrases are like rooms or sections of the house (e.g., a "kitchen," a "bedroom") ‚Äì they have a specific purpose but aren't a complete house on their own.

## 3.5 Clauses: The Mini-Sentences

A `clause` is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate. Clauses are the core of sentence structure.

*   **Independent Clause (Main Clause):** This clause can stand alone as a complete sentence because it expresses a complete thought.
    *   **Example:** `She smiled.` `The dog barked loudly.`
*   **Dependent Clause (Subordinate Clause):** This clause contains a subject and predicate but cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It depends on an independent clause for its full meaning. Dependent clauses are introduced by subordinating conjunctions or relative pronouns.
    *   **Types of Dependent Clauses:**
        *   **Noun Clause:** Functions as a noun within a sentence, acting as a subject, object, or complement. For example, `I know *that she is intelligent.*`
        *   **Adjective Clause (Relative Clause):** Functions as an adjective, modifying a noun or pronoun in the main clause. For example, `The book *that I read* was interesting.`
        *   **Adverb Clause:** Functions as an adverb, modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb in the main clause, often answering questions like `when`, `where`, `why`, `how`, `to what extent`. For example, `She studied *until midnight*.`

**üåê Real-World Analogy:** If phrases are rooms, clauses are like self-contained apartments. An independent clause is an apartment you can live in alone. A dependent clause is an apartment that's part of a larger building (the independent clause) and can't stand by itself.

## 3.6 Idioms: The Colorful Expressions

*   **Definition:** An idiom is a group of words established by usage as having a meaning that is not directly deducible from the individual words themselves. They add color, nuance, and naturalness to language.
*   **Importance:** Learning idioms helps you understand native speakers and sound more natural yourself. They reflect cultural context and historical usage.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `It's raining cats and dogs.` (Meaning: It's raining very heavily.)
    *   `Break a leg!` (Meaning: Good luck!)
    *   `Bite the bullet.` (Meaning: To endure a difficult or unpleasant situation.)
    *   `Cost an arm and a leg.` (Meaning: Very expensive.)
    *   `Hit the road.` (Meaning: To leave.)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Errors to Avoid:**
*   **Sentence Fragments:** These are incomplete sentences lacking a subject or a full predicate. For example, `Running in the park.` (lacks a subject).
*   **Run-on Sentences:** Occur when two or more independent clauses are incorrectly joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions. For example, `I love to read I read every day.` This should be `I love to read; I read every day.` or `I love to read, and I read every day.`.
*   **Comma Splices:** A specific type of run-on sentence where two independent clauses are joined only by a comma. For example, `It was cold, I wore a coat.` This should be `It was cold; I wore a coat.` or `It was cold, so I wore a coat.`.
*   **Subject-Verb Agreement (Prelim):** The verb in a sentence must agree in number with its subject (a singular subject takes a singular verb, a plural subject takes a plural verb). This is covered more deeply in Week 5. For example, `The dog run.` is incorrect, it should be `The dog runs.`.
