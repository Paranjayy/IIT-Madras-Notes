# theory notes
- can we create highly comprehensive thorough going through each and every  notes consisting all the concepts,facts,procedure(tacit informations and teaching just like mentor/prof/teacher and can ramble about thingies or go to different tangents and nerd about things too) lets create nice notes just like a textbook would covering each and everything in nice aesthetic manner be it be callouts,tables or more and simplifying thingies with irl analogies/intuitive sense -- and stages/phases/spectrums(patterns) & duration/path/outcome(just basic not verbose) creating nice dissertation 
- breaking down each and everything like going through each and fucking everything because we are learning everything for first time or anybody learner can read it like it must be timeless legendary nobody needs to go outside these notes like our aim is to crystal clear learn
	- dissecting everything and deciphering everything just for best possible foundational/core concepts and understanding so that can solve or tackle anything and everything
	- nice cohesive coherent notes in chronological order and rhizomatic learning i would use it in obsidian/quartz nice interlinked cool notes just like wikipedia like highly professional
	- latex notes in obsidian latex like $math$ for inline math and $$math$$ for display math
	- suggest me nice titles like apt thingies semantic stuffs and also have nice metadata too

# summary/practice notes
- first would need to create a single file consisting all the concepts or everything need to know in brief summary
- after that you will have to identify patterns from assignments/pyqs(create highly comprehensive solution and write down all the tacit details like a teacher/mentor would explain and easy to read for first time learner or expert or any level of stage) &  you can create or find more questions which i can practice upon also you can give answer too without spoiler somehow within it 
	- like there are questions of probably in stats like finding out particular thingies there are many similar type of questions make its category pattern and solve them each unique kinda thingies like there are multiple permutations and combinations thingies (just as an example this was for you but you would have to create for each course nicely)
- it would be nice consolidated cool stuffs for me :) 


do you get the aim
