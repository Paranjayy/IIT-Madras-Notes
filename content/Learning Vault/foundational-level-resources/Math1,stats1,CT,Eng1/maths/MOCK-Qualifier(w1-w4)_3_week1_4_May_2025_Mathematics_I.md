### Question 1

Let $r(x)$ be a polynomial function which is obtained as the quotient after dividing the polynomial $p(x)=-\left(x+5\right)\left(x-3\right)\left(x^{2}-16\right)$ by the polynomial $q(x)=-\left(x-4\right)\left(x+4\right)$. Choose the correct option(s) which represent(s) the polynomial $r(x)$ most appropriately.
