### Question 4

An ant named $B$, wants to climb an uneven cliff and reach its anthill (i.e., home of ant). On its way home, $B$ makes sure that it collects some food. A group of ants have reached the food locations which are at $x-$intercepts of the function $f(x)= \left(x^2-24\right)\left(\left(x-10\right)^{3}-1\right)$. As ants secrete pheromones (a form of signals which other ants can detect and reach the food location), $B$ gets to know the food location. Then the sum of the $x$\-coordinates of all the food locations is
