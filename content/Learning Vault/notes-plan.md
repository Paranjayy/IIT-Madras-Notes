- I want highly comprehensive thorough notes going through each and every concepts/facts/procedure and stages/phases/spectrums(patterns) & duration/path/outcome(just basic not verbose)
	- notes structure first going through all the concepts and thingies and can have exercises or example questions like theory textbooks and explain or go through all the details like a mentor/coach/prof/teacher(you can nerd out thingies or yap about tacit stuffs if required or ingeneral all the thingies i need to know or how to go about thingies and more) would and also make sure to make everything nicely cohesive coherent and rhizomatic thingies like i would use it as quartz/obsidian or notion thingy later like i want everything nicely to interlinked like wikipedia content or more like i really want to become proficient/gain expertise/mastery and super intutitve cool notes overall
	- once all the theory like textbook is done then create notes of summary of all the concepts or short notes + references to pyqs or assignments questions or mock questions which i gave or you can create new questions or more questions you can find from your training data or web and solve them and create nice dissected/deciphered thingies 
	- i have gave or kept syllabus at [[IIT Madras Qualifier + First 4 Courses Full]] & Pyqs or thingies at quartz/content/foundational level resources(there are btw markdown files which i scrapped from my chrome extension which i created with you cursor and also gave compelte assignments/mocks thingy complete ss and also there are pyq's of previous qualifiers and more)


- thats kinda all info above thingy you need but most important thingy is to implementation plan or actions for further thingy like i prompt/context maxxed you how i want the content 
	- maintain nice index or interlinked cool thingies (not just for coolness but ingeneral inline linking or metadata linking and more just for better navigation like dont overdo/underod and more)
	- go through all the concepts in each course/weekly notes and just like previous instructions follow aptly (concepts/facts/procedure/examples)
	- about notes summary or pyqs thingies (i really want you to give complete solution and follow as i said previously)
	- and anything more cool you would like to add which could help optimise or woudl be optimal for our notes stuffs or more please ; ) 


- can we create nice dissertation or timeless goated notes for anyone and everyone like for anyone reading they must feel awe or like no need to go anywhere else kinda and more please : ) 

- ask me questions if need any clarifications i would respond to you

hey it is awesome banger just what i wanted but  you mixed up or consolidated all thingies in single file icant 

- i wish you did just concepts/facts/procedure like 1/2 few example in the main theory file 

- second file would contain all the pyqs/assignments/your own created questions before that at the start there would be brief/sumamry of all first 4 qualifier courses and after it going through all kinda questions patterns likke there are only limited concepts and limited types of mcqs/numericals and more
