The IITM BS program strives to secure scholarships from CSR and Alumni donations for its students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds to cover the full program fees.

As intermittent support till such donations are secured, IIT Madras covers part of the fees for the BS program students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

The fraction of IIT Madras' fee support depends on the learner's category and family income and is given below:

||Family Income > 5 LPA|   |Family Income > 1 LPA and <= 5 LPA|   |Family Income <= 1 LPA|   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Fee Support  <br>from IIT Madras|Docs Required|Fee Support  <br>from IIT Madras|Docs Required|Fee Support  <br>from IIT Madras|Docs Required|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|General|N/A|NIL|50%|EWS + Family Income|75%|EWS + Family Income|
|OBC|N/A|NIL|50%|OBC-NCL + Family Income|75%|OBC-NCL + Family Income|
|SC / ST|50%|SC / ST|50%|SC / ST|75%|SC / ST + Family Income|

Once you login, click on the tab "My current courses" and the links to the 4 courses will be available. Click on a course and access the videos, practice assignments and notes.

**The content will be accessible before the end of today.**

**Content and Assignments**

Every week, about 2 to 3 hours of videos by the course instructor(s) will be released for each of the following courses:

* Mathematics for Data Science I

* Statistics for Data Science I

* Computational Thinking

* English I

Along with the videos, we will also release the following material as is relevant:

* Activity questions for each lecture

* A practice assignment

* A graded assignment (or simply “Assignment”)

* Transcripts of the lectures as PDFs

* Slides used by the instructors as PDFs

* Solution document for the practice assignment

* Answers to frequently asked questions of the previous week.

**Suggested sequence for studying:**

1. Watch the first video lecture.

2. The activity questions are intended to test the basic understanding of the concepts covered in the lecture watched. So attempt this after you watch the lecture. Revisit the video if you do not get some answers correct.

3. Repeat this sequence of video-activity questions for every video lecture given.

4. After watching all videos of a week, you can attempt the practice assignment. The questions in the practice assignment test the understanding of a combination of concepts taught in one or more lectures. As the name indicates, this assignment will give you some practice before attempting the actual graded assignment. Once you attempt the questions, if you are unsure of the answers, please read the solution document or watch the solution video to clarify your doubts.

5. After satisfactorily attempting the practice assignment, you can attempt the graded assignment. The graded assignment has been designed in such a way that it has a balanced distribution of easy, medium and difficult questions. This can be submitted multiple times before the deadline, and the latest submission will be considered for grading. The score will be available only after the due date-time has passed.

Submissions will be possible only until the mentioned time on the due date mentioned.

****************************************************

Submission deadline for graded assignments in qualifier month:

****************************************************

The due date and time will be mentioned in every graded assignment. No exception will be given to this deadline since the whole process of grading is automated. The solution for the graded assignment will be released as a document and a video once the deadline for submission is over. There will be graded assignments for the first 4 weeks. 

Please do the assignments yourself and even if you take help, ensure that you know how to solve it on your own. These assignments will help you prepare for the quizzes and final exams. Plagiarism and violating the honour code will be taken very seriously, if detected during the submission of assignments.

******************************

Perseverance is the key:

******************************

Please watch the lectures, follow the courses regularly and submit all assignments well before the due date so that technical issues like bad internet connection or a system problem will not hamper your progress in the course. Your regular participation is vital for learning and excelling in the program. Our course support members will have regular interactions with you via live sessions and discussion forums. Please make use of these sessions to clear your doubts.

**********************************************

Announcements and discussion forums:

**********************************************

The announcement emails from the course instructors and course support members will be sent regarding the lessons, assignments, exam registration, hall tickets etc. Make sure to check your email Inbox everyday so that you do not miss out on important messages. We will also send messages through sms and whatsapp. Please do check these also regularly.

The discussion forums are for everyone to ask questions and interact. Anyone who knows the answers can reply to anyone's post. The course instructor/course support members will also respond to your queries. Please make maximum use of this feature as this will help you learn much better. Also, ensure that you follow basic discussion forum etiquette. Follow the discussion forum closely and read the questions previously asked so that you can refrain from asking the same.

Admission to the Foundation Level

**Regular entry:** All candidates, irrespective of their backgrounds, can earn admission to the Foundation Level by successfully completing the qualifier process. [See details below](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/admissions.html#AD7) 

**JEE-based entry:** Candidates eligible to appear for the most recent JEE Advanced are directly admitted to the Foundation Level. [See details below](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/admissions.html#AD8) 

Regular Entry

All regular entry applicants must go through the Qualifier Process to earn admission to the Foundation Level.

**Qualifier Preparation:** The qualifier process includes 4 weeks of coursework based on lecture videos, assignments, and live sessions of the four foundational level courses - English I, Mathematics for Data Science I, Statistics for Data Science I, and Computational Thinking - that will be provided through our online portal. Every week an assignment must be submitted for grading in each course.

**Qualifier Exam:** At the end of the 4 weeks, a qualifier exam will be conducted for eligible candidates based on the content covered in the 4 weeks of study.

**Eligibility to appear for the qualifier exam (regular entry):**  

In each course, the average of the best 2 out of the first 3 assignment scores will be calculated. Only those who get the minimum required average assignment scores in all four courses (as given below) will be allowed to appear for the Qualifier Exam.

|   |   |
|---|---|
||Minimum Average Assignment Score required in each course|
|General Learner|40%|
|SC / ST / PwD with 40% disability|30%|
|PwD with 40% disability & SC / ST|30%|
|OBC-NCL / EWS|35%|

_Note: Relaxations in pass criteria indicated for various categories of learners is applicable ONLY for the qualifier process. There will be no relaxations in terms of grades / pass criteria once registered into the program._

**Qualifier Exam and Passing Criteria (regular entry):**  

Only learners who are eligible to appear for the qualifier exam will receive the hall ticket for it.

The in-person Qualifier Exam at the end of 4 weeks of coursework is of 4 hours duration and covers all 4 courses.

**To pass the Qualifier Exam**, the learner has to get a minimum Average Qualifier Exam Score and a minimum Qualifier Exam Score in each course individually. Refer table:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Min. Req. Qualifier Exam Score in each course**|**Min. Req. Average Qualifier Exam Score**|
|General Learner|40%|50%|
|SC / ST / PwD with 40% disability|30%|40%|

Only those who pass the Qualifier Exam will be eligible to register for the Foundation Level courses.

**Validity of the Qualifier Exam result:**  
  For candidates who have already appeared for or cleared class 12 board exams, the Qualifier Exam result is valid for a period of 3 terms (or 1 year). So, a learner may choose to not join the program immediately after clearing the Qualifier Exam and join in the second or third term following the Qualifier Exam.  
  For candidates who are yet to appear for class 12 board exams, the Qualifier Exam result is valid for a period of 6 terms (or 2 years). The extended validity is given to these candidates to facilitate joining the program after passing class 12.  

Though everyone who passes the Qualifier Exam will be allowed to register for Foundation Level, there will be limitations on the number of courses a learner will be allowed to register for in their first term based on the Average Qualifier Exam Score (M).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Average Qualifier Exam Score (M)**|**Number of courses allowed to register for**|
|Minimum required <= M < 50%|up to 2 courses|
|50% <= M < 70%|up to 3 courses|
|M >= 70%|up to 4 courses|

  

**Re-attempt Qualifier Exam (regular entry)**  

Learners who were eligible to appear for the qualifier exam, but did not clear the qualifier exam or were absent for it, will be eligible to re-attempt the qualifier exam in the same term (refer [important dates](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/admissions.html#AD0)) without having to repeat the assignments.

Anyone who is eligible may apply by filling in the re-attempt application form that opens up immediately after the qualifier results are announced and paying the re-attempt fee.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|General Category / OBC Applicant|₹1500 re-attempt fee|
|SC / ST Category / PwD (>= 40% disablity ) Applicant|₹750 re-attempt fee|
|SC / ST Category Applicant who is ALSO PwD (>= 40% disablity )|₹375 re-attempt fee|

Learners who are not eligible to re-attempt OR do not clear the re-attempt exam may try again by applying again for the next term. Such learners will be required to pay the full application fee (₹3000 for general category applicants) and go through the entire qualifier process including the weekly assignments and qualifier exam.

JEE-based Entry

Candidates qualified to appear for current year's JEE Advanced can directly join our program by following the steps below:

STUDENT HOUSES & SOCIETIES

Get empowered, be part of our

virtual campus, build real communities

and become future leaders.

Here in IITM BS degree, students, faculty and staff work together to support students make the most of their opportunities.

#### Student Houses

![](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/assets/img/studentlife/HouseStructure-2.svg)

All students in the programme will be divided into 12 houses named after the forests in India.

##### Your house is where you seek, share, support and study together and do what you love through clubs and activities.

We invite the Student community to feel at home in their forest houses of Bandipur, Corbett, Gir, Kanha, Kaziranga, Nallamala, Namdapha, Nilgiri, Pichavaram, Saranda, Sundarbans and Wayanad.

Each house accommodates nearly 30 groups of 20 students each where the group members are from the same city or neighbouring cities and house members are from across the country.

##### Upper House Council & Elections

Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of all 12 houses constitute the Upper House Council that governs all houses.

The Student Elections Committee constituted by Student Affairs conducts free and fair elections every August, where all the house members elect their Secretary and Deputy Secretary for a tenure of one year. The Secretary of the house in turn conducts elections for all groups, where all group members elect their Group leaders. The Secretaries and Group leaders are below 25 years of age.
